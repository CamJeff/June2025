This is a tool I made to aid in Jane Street's June 2025 Puzzle, which is found [here](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/some-ones-somewhere-index/).

# Instructions

Simply drag and drop the coloured square tiles on the grided-out board. To disacrd a square tile, you must drag at least 50\% of the piece outside the bounds of the board. You may also need to "click" on the piece to see it disappear. If you are lazy, you can also just overalp pieces with each other instead of discarding. It's probably easier this way.
